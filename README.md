# FileandFolderCreator
Hello all,

I  created this program as a way to learn python and to create folders with corresponding txt files inside based on the names in an array

Code is a class to create folders with empty text files in them with the same name as the folder. 

The code in the beginning that is commented out is mom's spaghetti. Code below that is done with classes.
I kept the commented out code as a way to teach myself how to use Classes. Any tips or advice on how to improve is always welcomed

arguement 1 is a string of parent directory where the tree will be created
arg 2 is an array of names that will be assigned to created folders and text file. files and folders will have the same name
